## Setup

The lab can be started in different ways
- In GitHub Codespaces
- Locally on your laptop using `poetry`

:::info
it's also possible to start the lab locally with devcontainer but this method is not covered in this documentation
:::

### Start on Github Codespace

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/opsmill/ac2-workshop-data-modeling?devcontainer_path=.devcontainer%2Fdevcontainer.json&ref=main)

### Install locally with poetry

#### install poetry

Poetry is a popular package manager for Python, it can be installed with the following command
```shell
pipx install poetry
```

Check out the official documentation for poetry for more information

#### Clone the git repository

```shell
git clone https://github.com/opsmill/ac2-workshop-data-modeling.git
cd ac2-workshop-data-modeling
```

#### Install the python packages with poetry

```shell
poetry install
```

#### Enter the python environment created by poetry

By default, poetry install all the packages in a dedicated python environment so in order for the lab to work you need to enter the right environment using the following command

```shell
poetry shell
```

:::info
As an alternative, it's possible to execute commands inside the python environment using `poetry run` in front of all commands.
