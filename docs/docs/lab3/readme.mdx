## Network infrastructure modeling with Infrahub

The goal of the third lab is to get familiar with a model representing a simple network but highlighting the benefits and the challenges to combine Role, Status and Kind together along with a strict model.

For this environment, you will be provided with an instance of Infrahub running in GCP, each student will have a dedicated instance.
