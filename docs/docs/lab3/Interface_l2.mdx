title: Add interface L2
---

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
import ReferenceLink from "../../src/components/Card";

The current schema support L3 Interfaces with potential IP addresses but it doesn't currently support other type of interfaces like L2.

Since we already have a Generic `DcimInterface`, we can create a new Interface L2 node that will inherit from `DcimInterface`

## Create a new InterfaceL2 node

Create a new file `workshop_b2/lab3/schemas/interface_l2.yml` and with the content displayed below

```yaml
---
version: "1.0"
nodes:
  - name: InterfaceL2
    namespace: Dcim
    label: Interface L2
    icon: mdi:ethernet
    menu_placement: DcimInterface
    display_labels:
      - name__value
    inherit_from:
      - DcimInterface
      - DcimEndpoint
    attributes:
      - name: status
        kind: Dropdown
        optional: true
        choices:
          - name: active
            label: Active
            description: Fully operational and currently in service.
            color: "#7fbf7f"
          - name: provisioning
            label: Provisioning
            description: In the process of being set up and configured.
            color: "#ffff7f"
          - name: maintenance
            label: Maintenance
            description: Undergoing routine maintenance or repairs.
            color: "#ffd27f"
      - name: l2_mode
        label: Layer2 Mode
        kind: Text
        enum:
          - Access
          - Trunk
          - Tunnel
```

## Load the updated schema

```shell
infrahubctl schema load workshop_b2/lab3/schemas --branch schema01
```

## Load some additional data

Create new L2 interfaces with the following commands

```shell
infrahubctl object load workshop_b2/lab3/data/interface_l2.yml --branch schema01
```

## Explore the new interfaces from the frontend

In the frontend, navigate to the `interfaces` tab on the device `den1-router1`.

As shown in the screenshot below we can see that both InterfaceL3 and InterfaceL2 are displayed together.

This is possible because Interface L2 and interface L3 are both inheriting from the same `DcimInterface`

## Explore the new interfaces from the frontend

In the GraphQL Sandbox, execute the following command

```graphql
query {
  DcimDevice(name__value: "den1-router1" ) {
     edges {
      node{
        interfaces {
          edges {
            node {
              name {
                value
              }
              ...on DcimInterfaceL2 {
                l2_mode {
                  value
                }
              }
              ...on DcimInterfaceL3 {
                ip_addresses {
                  edges {
                    node {
                      address {
                        value
                      }
                    }
                  }
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

the command above is using from Fragment in GraphQL to retrive all interfaces in a single list but also access attributes specific to InterfaceL2 or InterfaceL3
