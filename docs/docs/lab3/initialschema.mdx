To start the lab, we'll load an initial schema into Infrahub and later on we'll explore how we extend it to explore some advanced features

## Explore the initial schema

The provided schema is meant to be a good starting point

it includes a handful of node types
- City
- Device
  - InterfaceL3
- IP address
- Prefix

Most of these nodes are leveraging some generics to make it easier to extend the schema. We'll explore that in a moment


## Create a branch and load the schema into the branch

When working on a new schema it's often required to try different solutions and to start from scratch in the process.
When dealing with an application managing data, it's usually not possible to try a change in isolation and start from scratch if needed

In Infrahub, it's possible to use a branch as an isolated environment to try new things and we can easily delete the branch if the changes aren't ready to be integrated into main.

Since we are using `infrahubctl` to load the schema, it's logical to also use it to manage branches

### Manage branches using `infrahubctl`

```shell
infrahubctl branch list
infrahubctl branch create <branch_name>
infrahubctl branch delete <branch_name>
```

:::info
The account student doesn't have the permissions to make changes to the default branch (main) so the creation a branch is mandatory for this account.

## Create a new branch and load the schema

Create a branch using `infrahubctl`
```shell
infrahubctl branch create schema01
```

Load the initial schema

```shell
infrahubctl schema load workshop_b2/lab3/schemas --branch schema01
```

## Load some data to go with the schema

To go along with the schemas some data have been prepared in the directory `workshop_b2/lab3/data`

We'll use the command `infrahubctl object load` to load the data into infrahub directly

```shell
infrahubctl object load workshop_b2/lab3/data/site.yml --branch schema01
infrahubctl object load workshop_b2/lab3/data/device.yml --branch schema01
infrahubctl object load workshop_b2/lab3/data/interface_l3.yml --branch schema01
infrahubctl object load workshop_b2/lab3/data/prefix.yml --branch schema01
infrahubctl object load workshop_b2/lab3/data/ipaddress.yml --branch schema01
```
> Please note that the other of these commands is important

:::info
The command `infrahubctl object load` is still under active developement and that's why it's hidden by default.
